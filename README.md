# Sleep Cycles

⚠ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠

A project to calculate various times to wake up or fall asleep to align with your natural sleep cycles. By waking up at the end of one of these 90 minute cycles, you will have a better night's rest. This project was *heavily* inspired by [Sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/), but I wanted to see if I could do it by myself. This is my first time using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a front-end, component-based Javascript framework. For that matter, this is my first project using any front-end, component-based Javascript framework. I figured that it was about time I learn one of these Javascript frameworks, and Svelte seemed like the most intuitive one after watching a [video by Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuHDQhDhvPE) comparing several of them. If I didn't start learning one, I might've had to make my own -- and the world doesn't need yet another Javascript framework.
